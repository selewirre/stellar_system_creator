.. _star:

A star is a celestial object that is massive enough to sustain nuclear fission in it's core.
In this package we will only work with main sequence stars.
Their :ref:`masses <mass>` vary between :math:`0.08 \, {\rm M_s}` and :math:`150 \, {\rm M_s}`.

The more massive the star, the bigger it's :ref:`size <radius>`, the more :ref:`luminous <luminosity>` it is,
and the smallest its :ref:`lifetime <lifetime>` will be.
Ideal for :ref:`life <habitability>` stars, are stars with :ref:`mass <mass>` between :math:`0.6 \, {\rm M_s}`
and :math:`1.4 \, {\rm M_s}`.

Stars can form :ref:`stellar binaries <binary_system>` and host :ref:`planets <planet>`
and :ref:`asteroid belts <asteroid_belt>`, either together or separately from their companion star (or both).
