Trojan Satellite
================

.. _trojan_satellite:

A trojan satellite is a celestial object that is :ref:`orbiting <orbital>` around a :ref:`star <star>`
while locked in the L4 or L5 :ref:`Lagrange point <lagrange_position>` of a :ref:`planet <planet>`.
Its :ref:`composition <composition_type>`
varies between a rocky world and water world.
There is no a minimum :ref:`mass <mass>` requirement.

The more :ref:`massive <mass>` the parent :ref:`planet <planet>`,
the more massive a trojan satellite can be.
If a trojan satellite is massive enough, it can resemble a planet and can
potentially sustain :ref:`life <habitability>`.
