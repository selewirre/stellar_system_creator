Trojan
======

.. _trojan:

Trojans are multiple small celestial objects that are :ref:`orbiting <orbital>` around a :ref:`star <star>`
while locked in the L4 or L5 :ref:`Lagrange point <lagrange_position>` of a :ref:`planet <planet>`.
Their :ref:`composition <composition_type>`
varies between a rocky world and water world.
There is no a minimum :ref:`mass <mass>` requirement.

The more :ref:`massive <mass>` the parent :ref:`planet <planet>`,
the higher the total :ref:`massive <mass>` trojan can be.
