Normalized Greenhouse
=====================

.. _normalized_greenhouse:

The normalized greenhouse effect :math:`g` is a measure of the greenhouse effect in the atmosphere of a planet.
It takes values between 0 and 1. The closer to 1, the higher the temperature of the planet will be.
When you get close to 1 (e.g. 0.99), adding a new 9 at the end (e.g. 0.999) will dramatically increase the effect.

The normalized greenhouse effect on earth is approximately 0.34.
