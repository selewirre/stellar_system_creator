Heat Distribution
=================

.. _heat_distribution:

Heat distribution :math:`\beta` is the measure of how well a planet distributes heat,
and can take values from 0 to 1. It highly depends on the rotation speed of the planet.

The faster the rotation, the closer the number is to 1 (usually 1 for all non-tidally locked planets).
The heat distribution is 0.5 for a planet that is :ref:`tidally locked <tidal_locking_radius>` to its parent.
