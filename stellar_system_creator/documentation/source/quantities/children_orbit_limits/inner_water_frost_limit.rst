Inner Water Frost Limit
=======================

.. _inner_water_frost_limit:

We use :ref:`Selsis insolation model <selsis_insolation_model>` since it allows for easy, Solar system comparisons.
As shown on the wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frost_line_(astrophysics), there are different
frost lines for different compounds. Water is important and seems to determine the line between gas planets and
rocky planets.

It must be noted that gas giants can migrate to inner orbits after their creation,
so it is not impossible to find one where venus or mercury would have been. It would however
probably destabilize any other planets in its path.

The inner limit is taken from wiki's suggestion for big sized bodies at ~1.94 AU (~200 K).
