Tidal Locking Radius
====================

.. _tidal_locking_radius:

The tidal locking radius is the furthest distance a child would be tidally locked
to its parent. Tidal locking means that an orbiting object around a parent turns
around itself at the same amount of time it turns around its parent.
One side of the planet is always faces the parent, while the other side
does not.

The tidal locking radius is larger the more :ref:`massive <mass>` the parent is,
and the more :ref:`old <age>` it is. Many parameters of the child object
determine the tidal locking radius, but they are hard to estimate,
so treat this this number as a suggestion rather than a hard limit.
