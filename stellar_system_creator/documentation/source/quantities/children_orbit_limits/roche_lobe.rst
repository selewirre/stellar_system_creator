Roche Lobe
==========

.. _roche_lobe:

Roche lobe (or sphere) (not to be confused with :ref:`Roche limit <roche_limit>`) is the region
around a star in a binary system within which orbiting material is gravitationally bound to that star.

For an object of :ref:`mass <mass>` :math:`m` in a binary system, and a companion object of
:ref:`mass <mass>` :math:`m_c`, with a binary  :ref:`mean distance <semi_major_axis>` :math:`d`
and :ref:`eccentricity <eccentricity>` :math:`e`, the roche lobe is approximated by:
:math:`d (1 - e) \frac{0.49 \mu^{2/3}}{0.6\mu^{2/3} + \ln{\left(1 + \mu^{1/3}\right)}}`, where
:math:`\mu = \frac{m}{m_c}`.
