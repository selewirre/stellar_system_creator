Permanent Habitable Zone
==========================

.. _permanent_habitable_zone:

The Permanent Habitable Zone (PHZ) is a complex type of habitable zone in a :ref:`binary system <binary_system>`.
It takes into account the forced and periodically changing :ref:`eccentricity <eccentricity>`
of the :ref:`planets <planet>` due to the asymmetry
the two :ref:`stars <star>` of different :ref:`mass <mass>` introduce to the :ref:`stellar system <stellar_system>`.
It assumes that the climate of the potential habitable world is fast at immediately adjusting to the periodically changing
:ref:`eccentricity <eccentricity>`.
