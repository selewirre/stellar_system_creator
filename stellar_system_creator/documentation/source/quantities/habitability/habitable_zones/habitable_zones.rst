Habitable Zones
===============

.. _habitable_zones:

Habitable zone (HZ) is defined as an area between two orbital distances from a parent star or binary system
that life can exist. The extremes of the zone are probably not as hospitable to complex organisms
like ourselves, but you never know...

Depending on the system type, the habitable zone is estimated in different ways.
They always depend on the :ref:`luminosity <luminosity>` and :ref:`temperature <temperature>` of the star(s),
and often on the orbital :ref:`eccentricity <eccentricity>` of the potential habitable world.
The single star habitable zone or :ref:`SSHZ <single_star_habitable_zone>` is the simplest type of
HZ. For binary stars, there are three different types,
the radiative habitable zone or :ref:`RHZ <radiative_habitable_zone>`,
the permanent habitable zone or :ref:`PHZ <permanent_habitable_zone>`,
the average habitable zone or :ref:`AHZ <average_habitable_zone>`.
