Radius
======

.. _radius:

Radius is the variable that defines the size of celestial objects.
The radius determines the :ref:`circumference <circumference>`, :ref:`surface area <surface_area>`, :ref:`volume <volume>` and :ref:`density <density>`.
among other characteristics.
The suggested radius is determined by the :ref:`mass <mass>` of the
object via various radius models. Use values :math:`\pm 8` % around
the suggested value.
