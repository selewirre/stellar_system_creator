Composition Type
================

.. _composition_type:

The composition type of planets, planetoids, asteroids etc. is
what the approximate composition of a celestial object will be.
There are two types of iron worlds, two types of rocky worlds,
four types of water worlds, one type of ice- and one of gas-giants.

Even though the composition is not accurate by itself, I find
that the :ref:`density <density>` and :ref:`radius <radius>` of asteroids and moons that are not rocky,
can be generally approximated by the four different water worlds.
Same for small gassy worlds (like Pluto).
