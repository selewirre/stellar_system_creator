Mass

.. _mass:

Mass is the quantity of mater in a physical body.
In the context of this package, mass determines most of other physical characteristics,
like :ref:`radius <radius>`, :ref:`luminosity <luminosity>`, :ref:`spin period <spin_period>` and
:ref:`lifetime <lifetime>`.

Suggested (approximate) masses:

1. For moon-like satellites, less than 0.05 earth masses (Me)
2. For rocky planets: up to around 5 earth masses
3. For ice-giants: between 5 and 100 earth masses
4. For gas-giants: between 100 earth masses and 10 jupiter masses (Mj)
5. For long-lived, red stars: 0.081 and 0.5 solar masses (Ms)
6. For habitable stars: 0.6 to 1.4 solar masses
7. For short-live, big blue/white stars: 1.4 to 50 solar masses.
8. For :ref:`black holes <black_hole>` the mass should be approximately above 3.3 solar masses.
