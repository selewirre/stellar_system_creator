Inclination
===========

.. _inclination:

Orbital inclination is the tilt of a child object's orbit around a celestial body.
It varies between 0 and 180. Between 0 and 90, the orbit is prograde.
Between 90 and 180, the orbit is retrograde.

However, as of now, it is cosmetic and does not determine any other characteristics,
including the :ref:`orbit type <orbit_type>`.
