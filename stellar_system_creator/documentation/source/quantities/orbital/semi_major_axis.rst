Semi-Major Axis
===============

.. _semi_major_axis:

Semi-major axis :math:`a` is the mean distance between a child and a parent body.

When placing two objects in the same :ref:`celestial system <celestial_systems>`
with semi-major axes :math:`a_1` and :math:`a_2`,
try to space them out in such a way that :math:`a_2 = (1.4 \, {\rm to} \, 2) \cdot a1`.
Maintain this distance ratio for all new objects.
Also, make sure to stay within the :ref:`minimum <semi_major_axis_minimum_limit>`
and :ref:`maximum <semi_major_axis_maximum_limit>` limits since
the program will not stop the user from exceeding the limits.
