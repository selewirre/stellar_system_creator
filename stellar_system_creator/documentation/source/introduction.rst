Introduction
============

The Solar System Creator is a python package that aims to ease the creation of realistic
stellar systems in sci-fi settings. With minimal input, the user is able to create stars, planets,
moons, asteroid regions and other celestial bodies, with accurate physical characteristics, declare their habitability,
extract physical characteristics and visualize them.

For first-time users, reading the :ref:`graphics user interface guide <gui>` is highly suggested,
as it goes quickly though the base elements of the package with an example.

This documentation includes descriptions of all the :ref:`celestial bodies <celestial_bodies>`
and :ref:`celestial systems <celestial_systems>` included in this package, as well as all the
:ref:`physical quantities <quantities>` used in the astrophysical calculations, in an attempt to help
the user familiarize themselves with the meaning behind each (oftentimes enigmatic) names and labels.
