Radius
======

Radius is the variable that defines the size of celestial objects.
The suggested radius is determined by the :doc:`mass` of the object via various radius models.

Models used:

1. For planetary models, see https://arxiv.org/pdf/0707.2895.pdf.
2. For hot gas-giant models, see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03075.pdf.
3. For stellar models, see https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/479/4/5491/5056185.
