Composition Type
================

.. _composition_type:

The composition type of planets, planetoids, asteroids etc. is
what the approximate composition of a celestial object will be.
There are two types of iron worlds, two types of rocky worlds,
four types of water worlds, one type of ice- and one of gas-giants.

1. Iron worlds (e.g. Mercury) are :ref:`small <radius>`, very :ref:`dense <density>` and can sustain limited to no :ref:`tectonic activity <tectonic_activity>`, which is essential to :ref:`life <habitability>`.
2. Rocky worlds (e.g. Venus, Earth, Mars) are on average a bit :ref:`bigger <radius>`, :ref:`dense <density>` and can sustain substantial :ref:`tectonic activity <tectonic_activity>`.
3. Water worlds (e.g. `Gliese 1214b <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliese_1214_b>`_) are of similar :ref:`size <radius>` or a bit bigger compared to rocky worlds, :ref:`less dense <density>`, and depending on the amount of rock in their mantle, they may sustain :ref:`tectonic activity <tectonic_activity>`.
4. Ice giants (e.g. Neptune, Uranus) are :ref:`bigger <radius>`, :ref:`puffy <density>` and can not sustain any :ref:`tectonic activity <tectonic_activity>`.
5. Gas giants (e.g. Saturn, Jupiter) are the :ref:`biggest <radius>` of planets, very :ref:`puffy <density>` and can not sustain any :ref:`tectonic activity <tectonic_activity>`.


I find that the :ref:`density <density>` and :ref:`radius <radius>`
of asteroids and moons that are not rocky,
can be generally approximated by the four different water worlds,
even though the :ref:`chemical composition <chemical_composition>`
is not accurate by itself.
Same for small gassy worlds (like Pluto).
