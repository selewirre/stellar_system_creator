Lifetime
========

.. _lifetime:

The lifetime of stars is determined by its mass and its luminosity (:math:`T=\frac{M}{L}`).

The lifetime of each other body is determined by the lifetime of the parent
minus a hundred million years, which is roughly the amount of time it takes
for planets to form around stars (or satellites to be captured). It is by
no means binding.
