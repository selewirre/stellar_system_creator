Spin Period
===========

.. _spin_period:

The spin period is the amount of time it takes for a celestial body to
rotate around itself compared to the distant stars.

Planetary spin period is determined by the :ref:`mass <mass>` and :ref:`radius <radius>` of the celestial body.
The more massive the body, the faster it rotates.
If there are satellites around the planet large enough
(e.g. earth-moon), there is a substantial transfer of
angular momentum between the two bodies, making the planet
slow down (earth spin period would have been around 16 hr).
