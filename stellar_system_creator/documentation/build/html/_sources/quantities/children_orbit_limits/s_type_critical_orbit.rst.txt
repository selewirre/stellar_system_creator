S-type binary Critical Orbit
============================

.. _s_type_critical_orbit:

In wide binary systems (S-type binaries) of two objects with :ref:`masses <mass>`
:math:`m_1` and :math:`m_2` with :math:`m_1 > m_2`, :ref:`mean distance <semi_major_axis>` :math:`d`
and :ref:`eccentricity <eccentricity>` :math:`e`, the critical orbit limit is the *maximum*
distance at which an orbit stays stable around a single object.
This distance is different for each object and changes due to their mass difference.

For the primary star of :ref:`mass <mass>` :math:`m_1`, :math:`\mu` is determined
by the companions to the binary's mass ratio :math:`\mu = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}`.

For the secondary star of :ref:`mass <mass>` :math:`m_2`, :math:`\mu` is determined
by the companions to the binary's mass ratio :math:`\mu = \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2}`.

The critical distance is estimated by: :math:`d (0.464 - 0.38 \mu - 0.631 e + 0.586 \mu e + 0.15 e^2 - 0.198 \mu e^2)`.
