Eccentricity
============

.. _eccentricity:

Eccentricity :math:`e` determines how elliptic the orbit of a child around a parent body is.
:math:`e = 0` means that the orbit is circular, and :math:`e = 1` means
that the orbit resembles a line (not a stable orbit).

The closer to :math:`e = 0`, the more stable the orbit in single star systems.

For objects orbiting binary systems (P- or S-type), the preferred eccentricity
is not zero.
