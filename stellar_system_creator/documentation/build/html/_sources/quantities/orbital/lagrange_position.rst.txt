Lagrange Position
=================

.. _lagrange_position:

Lagrange positions/points (L#) are the equilibrium points between
two :ref:`masses <mass>` (grandparent :math:`m_1` and parent :math:`m_2`) that can
potentially host an object of small mass :math:`m_3`. There are
5 such points, three (L1, L2, L3) of which are unstable and two that are semi-stable (L4, L5).
Points L4 and L5 can host from multiple asteroid-type bodies to a small planet, depending on :math:`m_2`.

The rule of thumb is that the total :ref:`mass <mass>` of objects in these points
must be smaller than :math:`0.0018878 \cdot m_2` or smaller than the Gascheu's limit.
It must be noted that, since the three bodies are never just by themselves,
there are other orbital instabilities introduced that
further degrade the stability of the Lagrange points.
