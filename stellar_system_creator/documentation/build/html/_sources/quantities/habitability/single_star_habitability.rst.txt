Single Star Habitability
==========================

.. _single_star_habitability:

For a single :ref:`star <star>`, the habitability is determined by the following conditions:

1. There must be a viable :ref:`SSHZ <single_star_habitable_zone>` given by the :ref:`relaxed minimum limit <relaxed_minimum_limit>` and the :ref:`relaxed maximum limit <relaxed_maximum_limit>`.
2. The :ref:`relaxed maximum limit <relaxed_maximum_limit>` must not be smaller than the :ref:`inner orbit limit <inner_orbit_limit>`.
3. The :ref:`relaxed minimum limit <relaxed_minimum_limit>` must not be larger than the :ref:`outer orbit limit <outer_orbit_limit>`.
4. The :ref:`lifetime <lifetime>` or :ref:`age <age>`  must be bigger than 1 billion years. This minimum age limit is when life is expected to start developing (see `here <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00160399>`_).

These are the most relaxed criteria, so keep in mind that habitability varies
from object to object and the type of life that can survive on them.
