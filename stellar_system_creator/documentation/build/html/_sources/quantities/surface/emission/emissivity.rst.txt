Emissivity
==========

.. _emissivity:

Emissivity :math:`\epsilon` is the measure of how much of the overall radiation on the surface of an object
is emitted outside. Most planets have an emissivity close to 1 (the maximum value).
Emissivity of 0 (minimum value) means that no radiation is emitted.
