Peak Wavelength
===============

.. _peak_wavelength:

The :ref:`surface temperature <temperature>` :math:`T` of an object,
if it is an (close to) ideal black body object can be associated with
a profile of emitted wavelengths, with a single maximum.
For our sun, the maximum of the emission spectrum is around 500 nm (green).

In general, the peak wavelength it is given by: :math:`\lambda = \frac{2.898 \cdot 10 ^ 6 \,{\rm nm\, K}}{T}`.
