Luminosity
==========

.. _luminosity:

Luminosity is the measure of the emitted radiation from an object.
It is determined by the :ref:`mass <mass>` of the object, and the
:ref:`incident flux <incident_flux>` if it is relatively higher than the emitted flux
of radiation.

For star of :ref:`mass <mass>` :math:`M` in the main sequence, the luminosity
is given by various mass-luminosity relationships as in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass-luminosity_relation.
Use values :math:`\pm 8` % around the suggested value.

For a planet of :ref:`surface temperature <temperature>` :math:`T`,
:ref:`temperature-based incident flux <incident_flux>` :math:`S_T`,
:ref:`albedo <albedo>` :math:`A` and :ref:`surface area <surface_area>` :math:`A_S`,
the luminosity is determined by:
:math:`\sigma A_S T ^ 4 + A S_T A_S / 4`,
where :math:`\sigma` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.
