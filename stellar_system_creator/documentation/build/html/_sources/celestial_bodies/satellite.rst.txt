varies between a rocky world and water world.
There is no a minimum :ref:`mass <mass>` requirement.

The more :ref:`massive <mass>` the parent :ref:`planet <planet>`,
and the bigger the :ref:`distance <semi_major_axis>` between child-parent,
the more massive a satellite can be.
If a satellite is massive enough, it can resemble a planet and can
potentially sustain :ref:`life <habitability>`.
