Black Hole
==========

.. _black_hole:

A black hole is an object from which nothing can escape due to the immense gravity on its "surface" (called
the event horizon). The :ref:`radius <radius>` of a black hole the same mass as our sun is a bit shy
of 3 :math:`\rm km` (very tiny!!!). For this reason, this program renders the black hole and shows a magnified version
in an inset.

In the concept we are examining, a black hole could have occurred due to the collapse of a large star.
After millions to billions of years, the dust around the black hole is concentrated in bodies that constitute a
:ref:`stellar system <stellar_system>`. Of course, there can still be dust around the blackhole
but after a long time, most of is assumed to have be consumed, scattered or accumulated by other objects.
A single black hole system would be barren of life. However, a :ref:`P-type stellar binary system <binary_system>`
(two :ref:`stars <star>` orbiting around each other with a distance small enough that other objects rotate around
both at the same time) of a :ref:`star <star>` and a black hole could potentially harbor life.

It must be noted that black holes with visible accretion disks (depicted as a dark mass in the center and
two redish/yellowish rings around it, one ring vertical and one horizontal) are black holes that:

1. are in :ref:`contact <contact>` with a star and they are stealing its mass.
2. There is material scattered around the black hole, and they slowing get swallowed by the black hole.

In both cases, this depiction is relatively temporary, and the lifetime of such a picture depends
on the mass and the distance profile of the swallowed object/dust.
Since I was unsure of the timeline, I chose to depict black holes as black spheres with a small white outline.
However, if the accretion disk is massive and moves fast, it could potentially emit enough radiation to harbor
life by itself. I have not explored the physics of this scenario yet.

Keep these in mind if you want to change my boring picture with the much cooler looking one.
I am sure a black hole with(out) an accretion disk can make a lot of interesting and scientifically plausible
stories!
