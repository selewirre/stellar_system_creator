Planet
======

.. _planet:

A planet is a celestial object that is :ref:`orbiting <orbital>`
around a :ref:`star <star>` or a :ref:`binary stellar system <binary_system>`
and is massive enough to be rounded due to its own gravity, but not massive
enough to sustain nuclear fission in it's core.

In this package we will work with planets of a few distinct, but representative
:ref:`composition types <composition_type>`, that fall under four categories:
iron worlds, rocky worlds, water worlds, and ice/gas giants. Rocky and water
worlds are ideal for life, either on the land,
in the surface/underground ocean, or both.

Planets can host :ref:`satellites <satellite>`, :ref:`trojans <trojan>`,
and :ref:`trojan satellites <trojan_satellite>`, and orbit around :ref:`stars <star>`
or :ref:`stellar binaries <binary_system>`.
